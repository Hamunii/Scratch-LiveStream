# Scratch Live Stream Project v1.0
This is a scratch project designed to be played on https://turbowarp.org. This project is not allowed on the scratch website because it breaks a lot of rules.

HOW TO PLAY THE PROJECT: 
  1. Download the .sb3 file.
  2. Create a scratch project, but NEVER share it! (scratch account needed).
  3. While you are on the editor, press the File button, and choose Load from your computer.
  4. When the project is ready, go to https://turbowarp.org and paste the link to your project and press enter.
  5. When the project is loaded on TurboWarp, press the green flag and then the project is running.
  6. On another device, or just with your computer (new tab), go to https://turbowarp.org and write the project ID and press enter.
  7. If on multiple devices, then choose to Record on the most powerful one.

Please note: cloud variables change slowly, and becuase of that, the FPS of the recorder can't be too high or it will just mess up cloud variable updates.
Also, white color takes more space in the cloud vairables, and due to that the cloud variables update even slower. Your FPS will be forced to drop when cloud variable size is high to avoid messing up the cloud variable updates.

My whole project was based off of https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/424284621/ that project. So thanks to @SpaceBoy234 on scratch for the image scanner!
